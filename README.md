# üß∞ LLM Prompt Template Pack for Software Dev Tasks

 Below is a Prompt Engineering Template Pack for Software Development, designed for reuse and integration into your tools or workflow (e.g., with VS Code snippets, CLI tools, or custom GPT wrappers).

---

## üîß TEMPLATE FOR PROMPTING SOFTWARE CODE GENERATION

You can reuse this template depending on the type of development task.

```
### Role:
Act as a [Senior Frontend Engineer | Backend Developer | Software Architect].

### Task:
[Explain the goal concisely.]

### Context:
- [Mention relevant business logic or use case.]
- [Mention tech stack: language, framework, libraries.]

### Requirements:
- [Specific features or constraints.]
- [Performance or readability expectations.]

### Input:
- [Example of what is passed in.]

### Output:
- [What should be returned or rendered.]

### Edge Cases:
- [List any exceptions, empty states, invalid inputs.]

### Format:
- [Code only | Code with comments | Code with explanation]
```

### üí° EXAMPLES

#### üîπExample 1 ‚Äì Generate a React Component with Validation

```
Act as a Senior Frontend Engineer.

Task:
Write a React component in TypeScript for a newsletter signup form.

Context:
- We're using React 18, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.
- The backend expects a POST request to /api/signup with { email }.

Requirements:
- Validate email format using Zod.
- Disable the submit button when the form is invalid.
- Show error messages inline.

Input:
- An empty form with a single email field.

Output:
- A styled form with real-time validation and submit handler.

Edge Cases:
- Invalid email format
- Empty input
```

#### üîπExample 2 ‚Äì Debug an Error

```
Act as a senior JavaScript engineer.

Task:
Help me debug this error: "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')".

Context:
- This happens in a React component.
- I suspect the prop `items` is sometimes undefined.

Code:
```tsx
function List({ items }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map(item => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>)}
    </ul>
  );
}

What is the best way to fix this?
```

## ‚úÖ PROMPTING CHECKLIST FOR SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT

Before submitting a prompt, ask yourself:
- [ ] Did I clearly define the **task**?
- [ ] Did I provide the **tech context** (language, tools)?
- [ ] Did I include **input/output expectations**?
- [ ] Did I define **edge cases** or **constraints**?
- [ ] Did I format it clearly?

---

## üß† PRINCIPLES OF EFFECTIVE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROMPTS
1. Be specific about the task
Avoid: ‚ÄúGenerate code for a login system.‚Äù
Use: ‚ÄúWrite a React component that displays a login form with email and password fields, validates inputs on blur, and submits the form to a POST /login endpoint.‚Äù
2. Include all technical constraints
Mention the language, framework, libraries, data formats, etc.
Example: ‚ÄúUse TypeScript with React and TailwindCSS. Input should be typed using Zod schema.‚Äù
3. Structure your prompt
A clear layout improves results dramatically:
```
### Task:
### Context:
### Requirements:
### Input/Output Examples:
```
4. Add edge cases or testing expectations
This helps the model generate more robust and usable code.
5. Use the right tone and role for the AI
Prompt it to behave like a senior engineer, architect, or code reviewer for clearer thinking.

---

## üß± 1. Code Generation

```
Generate [language] code that [brief functionality description].

Requirements:
- Input: [input types or parameters]
- Output: [expected output or return type]
- Constraints: [frameworks, no external libs, performance, etc.]

Example: 
Generate a Python function that takes a list of numbers and returns the median value. No external libraries.
```

---

## üßº 2. Code Refactoring

Use this when you want the AI to clean up messy code or improve it while preserving behavior.

### Prompt 1

```
Role: Act as a Senior Software Engineer who specializes in clean code and refactoring.

Task: Refactor the code below to improve readability, maintainability, and performance without changing its external behavior.

Context:
- Tech stack: [e.g. JavaScript with React]
- The code currently works, but it‚Äôs difficult to understand and maintain.
- Prefer functional style / use hooks / use async/await, etc. (optional)

Code:
// Paste your current implementation

Goals:
- Improve naming and structure.
- Eliminate redundant or nested logic.
- Break large functions into smaller ones.
- Optional: Add comments or docstrings for clarity.

```

### Prompt 2

```
Refactor the following code to improve [clarity / performance / DRY / readability].

Constraints:
- [e.g., no external libraries, keep logic the same, modern syntax only]

Original Code:
[Insert code snippet here]
```

---

üîç 3. Code Review Feedback Prompt

Use this when you want the AI to critique your code like a senior engineer.

```
### Role:
Act as a Senior Frontend Engineer conducting a code review.

### Task:
Provide code review feedback focusing on correctness, readability, performance, and best practices.

### Context:
- Tech stack: [e.g. React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS]
- This component is part of a [feature/page/module name].
- Intended behavior: [briefly describe what it should do]

### Code:
``tsx
// Paste your code here
``
Review Guidelines:
- Point out any bugs or logic issues.
- Suggest improvements to naming, structure, or clarity.
- Recommend performance or accessibility improvements.
- Assume you‚Äôre giving feedback to a mid-level engineer.

```

---

## üêû 4. Debugging

```
Analyze and fix the following code. It's producing this error: ‚Äú[error message]‚Äù.

Expected behavior: [what should happen]
Actual behavior: [what happens instead]

Code:
[Insert buggy code here]

What‚Äôs the root cause, and how can I fix it?
```

---

## üß™ 5. Unit Test Generation

```
Write [unit/integration] tests for the following [function/class/component] using [testing framework].

- Cover normal use cases and edge cases.
- Use proper test naming conventions.

Code:
[Insert code to test]
```
---

## üìò 6. Documentation / Inline Comments

```
Document the following [function/class] using [JSDoc/docstring/inline comments].

Code:
[Insert code snippet]

Style guide: [Optional‚ÄîGoogle, PEP-8, etc.]
```

---

## ü§ù 7. Senior Engineer Pair Programming Prompt

Use this to get collaborative-style help, idea generation, or guidance.
```
Role: Act as a Senior Frontend Engineer pair programming with me.

Task: Help me build [describe the component/feature briefly].

Context:
- Tech stack: [e.g. React 18, Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS]
- Current progress: [I‚Äôve built the form, working on validation‚Ä¶]
- Roadblock: [I‚Äôm unsure how to handle X, or which pattern to use for Y]

Expectations:
- Ask clarifying questions like a real pair.
- Offer tradeoffs between solutions.
- Guide me but don‚Äôt take over‚Äîlet me think aloud if needed.

This format encourages the AI to act more like a thought partner and less like a code machine.
```

---

## üß† Bonus: Explain Code

```
Explain what the following [JavaScript/Python/etc.] code does, line by line.

Code:
[Insert code here]

Use plain language suitable for a junior developer.
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Bonus: Combine Prompts

You can also *chain* these prompts. For example:

```
> ‚ÄúFirst, refactor this code. Then give a code review on your own refactored version.‚Äù
```
